rust-planets.nu
===============

A Rust wrapper for the planets.nu API. It is currently a work in progress and is in no way usable.

Prerequisites
-------------

  * **Cargo:** This project uses Cargo as its build system, and so it is intended to be used by projects which are also built using Cargo;
  * **Rust master:** This project is maintained such that it will build using the master branch of the Rust compiler. If your project is built using an older version of Rust, there are no guarantees that this library will be compatible.

Installation
--------

To start using this library in a Cargo-enabled project:

### Linux

  * Install Rust and Cargo by following the Rust Guide's [installation instructions](http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html#installing-rust);
  * Add the following to your project's `Cargo.toml` file:
    ```
    [dependencies.planets_nu]
    git = "https://github.com/pshendry/rust-planets-nu.git"
    ```

### Other Operating Systems

No idea, sorry! Hopefully the [Rust Guide](http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html) has instructions for using Cargo libraries in your build environment.

Usage
